  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective date: June 21, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Riddle Puzzle - Word Puzzle</strong>! We respect your privacy and are committed to being fully transparent. This Privacy Policy explains that we do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal or non-personal information from you when you use our game.</p>

<h2>1. Minimal Data Collection for Leaderboard</h2>
<p>Riddle Puzzle - Word Puzzle gives players the option to enter a display name. This is used solely for showing names on the leaderboard. If you choose not to provide a name, the app will generate a random unique name ID for you. These names (user-entered or generated) are stored locally or in our leaderboard system to distinguish players.</p>
<p>No real personal data such as your email, phone number, or address is collected. The display names are not linked to any other identifying information and are used only for in-game ranking purposes.</p>

  <h2>2. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect any information, we do not share any information with any third parties. Our game is designed to work completely offline and does not require an internet connection to function, except to display ads or open links you choose, such as our Privacy Policy or our Play Store page.</p>

  <h2>3. Ads</h2>
  <p>To keep the app free, we may display ads provided by trusted ad networks like Google AdMob. These ad networks may use their own technologies to serve ads that may be relevant to you. We do not have access to or control over this data. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> for more information on how Google handles data for ads.</p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Riddle Puzzle - Word Puzzle is designed for general audiences and is suitable for players of all ages. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. Since we collect no data, parents can feel confident their children’s privacy is protected.</p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>Since we do not collect any data, changes to this policy are unlikely. However, if our practices change in the future (for example, if we add features that require data collection), we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and notify users by updating this page and the effective date.</p>

  <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our app, please contact us:</p>
  <p>Email: cosnametech@gmail.com</p>

  <h2>7. Leaderboard and Name Display</h2>
  <p>To enhance the competitive experience, Riddle Puzzle - Word Puzzle includes a leaderboard feature. You may choose to enter a name to appear on the leaderboard. If you skip entering a name, the app will automatically generate a random name ID (e.g., Player_1234).</p>
  <p>These names are shown publicly on the leaderboard to represent your score. No other data is collected or associated with your name. You can continue using the app whether or not you choose to enter a name.</p>
